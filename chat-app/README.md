# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

I have used create vite project insted of create-react-app  
and also i have used yarn instead of npm for package management

so the commads to running this application are:
yarn (for building project)
yarn dev (for running project)

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
