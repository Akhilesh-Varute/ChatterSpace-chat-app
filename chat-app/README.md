# React + Vite
#ChatterSpace     
A simple Chatting App     
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

I have used create vite project insted of create-react-app  
and also i have used yarn instead of npm for package management

so the commads to running this application are:    
yarn (for building project)     
yarn dev (for running project)

The database used here is Cloud Firebase, so every message is recorded inside it.    
and the Authentication used is Google Authentication

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
